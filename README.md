I am retired from a 30m year IT career, having dconsistantly held cutting-edge System Engineering positions, and 15 years IT Infracuture Dept Mgr, so I'm no
slooch when it comes to tech. However, I've been away from the daily attacks of one's and zero's for ten years now, and boy, has technology advanced from
when I retired. BUT, I'm a realistic and logical person and I know this will most likeluy be my very last system I'll ever have, so might as well go for
bleeding edge everything. I'm not a gamer but I AM a photographer, and actually a pretty damn good one for an ametuer. I'm basing the specs of this system, 
not on gaming, but on image and video editing. I'm so tired of playing "hurry up & wait" when editing an image using Photoshop on my current Dell 8940. I 
have literally thousands of photographs that I have taken  over the years and am looking forward to post-procdessing the majority of the best ones and 
selling them. It's something I have planned for many years, unfortubnately I've been disabled since 2017 and have undergone one major back surgery 
and one Super-Major back surgery, taking a full year to recouperate. ......I digress... sorry.....

I would like to meet someone who is as familier with the latewst technology as I was during my career to give me some advise so I don't inadvertantly purchase
hardware that I won't be able to get the full bang for the buck out of. I've spent many hours deeply in research and study taking it all in as far as the different
channels, etc that that need to be utilized correctly with the right hardware, otherwise I could screw up and buy parts that do not fit into the full specs of the 
baseboard, etc. You get my drift I think. Sooo.....

If anyone reads this and is willing to spend a few minutes on the phone so I can ask many questions I need to know, I wouold greatly appreciate it. 

Have a wonderful remainder of the weekend!

Aloha,
Jaci (Forrest)
