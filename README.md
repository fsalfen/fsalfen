- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @fsalfen
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...Building a bleeding edge high-end system using an Intel 12th Gen i9-12900k CPU.I had hoped it would be completed by now but financial restraints are limiting me to purchasing one piece of the puzzle per month. So far only the baseboard: GIGABYTE Z690 AORUS ELITE AX LGA 1700 Intel Z690 ATX Motherboard with DDR5, Quad M.2, PCIe 5.0, USB 3.2 Gen 2X2 Type-C, WiFi 6, 2.5GbE LAN. Here is my planned:

I am retired from a 30-year IT career, 6-Years R&D @ Intel, 24 Upper-level to Management of IT Infrastructure Dept for a national insurance company. I've been away from the daily attacks of one's and zero's for ten years now, and boy, has technology advanced from when I retired. BUT, I'm a realistic and logical 70-year old person, I figure the system I'm building above will most likely be my very last system I'll ever have, so might as well go for
bleeding edge everything. I'm not a gamer but I AM a photographer, and a pretty damn good one actually for an ametuer. I'm basing the specs of this system, 
not on gaming, but on mostly image and some video editing. I'm so tired of playing "hurry up & wait" when editing an image using Photoshop on my current Dell 8940. I have literally thousands of photographs that I have taken over the years and am looking forward to post-processing the majority of the best ones and 
spread the smiles they bring to those that have seen my work, and making a few bucks on the side. It's something I have planned for many years, unfortunately I've been disabled since 2017 and have undergone several back surgeries, including one very major surgery, and one more still to come.

If anyone reads this and is willing to spend a few minutes communicating with me if/when issues come up, I'd be very Grateful (Dead). üòä

Mahalo for reading this and Aloha,

Jaci (Forrest)
