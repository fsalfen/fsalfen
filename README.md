With that said, My questions are concerning FastCopy. 

FASTCOPY QUESTIONS:
I could not find the answers, hence this inquiry. 
Does FastCopy preserve all file metadata when copying or moving any kind or sort of files? This includes all image EXIF data contained in image files. Audio files fields such as Artist, Bit Rate, etc.  Office Apps formats with Date, File Creation Date, File Modification Date, etc?? Of course, this includes file attributes as well.

Thank you in advance, 
Jaci (Forrest)
